The "Look and Say" problem.

Sequence starts with "1". To produce the next string in the sequence, say it
out loud and record any digits. So it goes

```
1
11      one 1
21      two 1s
1211    one 2, two 1s
111221  one 1, one 2, two 1s
...
```

Write code that generates the nth element of the sequence.

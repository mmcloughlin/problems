<p>
Find the length of the longest substring <b><i>T</i></b> of a given string (consists of lowercase letters only) such that every character in <b><i>T</i></b> appears no less than <i>k</i> times.
</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b>
<pre>
Input:
s = "aaabb", k = 3

Output:
3

The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Example 2:</b>
<pre>
Input:
s = "ababbc", k = 2

Output:
5

The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.

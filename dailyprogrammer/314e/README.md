Given a list of integers separated by a single space on standard input, print
out the largest and smallest values that can be obtained by concatenating the
integers together on their own line.

# Sample Data

You'll be given a handful of integers per line. Example:

```
5 56 50
```

You should emit the smallest and largest integer you can make, per line. Example:

```
50556 56550
```

# Challenge Data

```
79 82 34 83 69
420 34 19 71 341
17 32 91 7 46
```

Output:

```
3469798283 8382796934
193413442071 714203434119
173246791 917463217
```
